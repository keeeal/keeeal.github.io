This post describes how I used OpenSCAD and Python to create a randomly generated puzzle cube.

I wrote the code for this project as an exercise in procedurally generate 3D-printable objects. The algorithm produces six pieces that fit together to form a cube. The pieces are presented in a dissasembled form so the user can have the satisfaction of solving the puzzle!
