## Projects

### Honours 2016

#### Beamz
I used deterministic fluids estimation to encode parameters of a radiation beam.

I then used these inputs to train a neural net to produce Monte Carlo-derived dose-distributions in artificial geometries.  Took it to a patient sample with moderate success.  


### PhD Work 2017-Now

#### DoseNet
Calculating radiation dose as quickly as Collapsed Cone Convolution, but as accurately as Monte Carlo.
