This post describes a project in which I used OpenSCAD and Python to create a randomly generated puzzle cube.

I wrote this code as an exercise in procedurally generating 3D-printable objects. The algorithm produces six pieces that fit together to form a cube. Since the puzzle is randomly generated, the user is not aware of the solution. This means that even the puzzle's creator can have the satisfaction of solving it for themselves!

## The algorithm

The algorithm starts with an array of zeros the same shape as the completed puzzle. Suppose our puzzle is a cube with sides of length 4, then it can be visualised like this:

### Faces

Each face of the puzzle cube must be numbered. The numbers themselves don't matter as long as they are non-zero and unique. The value of array elements in the centre of each face can be set straight away since there is only one puzzle piece that they can belong to. Edge and corner elements can be ignored for now. We can use colours to represent each face's value:

Everything described so far can be done (using numpy) with the following lines of code:

```python
x, y, z = shape
face_values = (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)
array = np.pad(np.zeros((x - 2, y - 2, z - 2)), 1,
    constant_values=face_values)
```

### Edges

The edges of the puzzle are the interesting part â€” the way they fit together is what makes it a puzzle at all! Along each edge of the puzzle, element values must be chosen at random. There are only two possible values that they can take: the values of the faces that meet at the edge.

Since the puzzle is a cube, there are a total of 12 edges to be considered. We can iterate through them by first considering each of the 3 axes (x, y, and z). For each axis, we then consider the index extremes of the other two (denoted in python as 0 and -1) and iterate through all 4 possible combinations. The final trick is using numpy's random choice function and indexing to give values to each edge all at once! The code for this is provided below:

```python
for axis in range(3):
    ends = 3*[(0, -1)]
    ends[axis] = (slice(None),)
    for idx in product(*ends):
        array[idx] = np.random.choice((
            face_values[axis - 1][idx[axis - 1]],
            face_values[axis - 2][idx[axis - 2]],
        ), shape[axis])
```

After all edge values have been chosen, the array should look something like this:

### Corners

Finally, we need to give values to the array's corner elements. But hang on, weren't the corners given random values in the last step? Why are those values not good enough? Well, there are two reasons. The last step only considered the values of two faces that meet at the edge, while at a corner there are three. But, more importantly, it is currently possible for a corner element to be disconnected from its face! Consider the following example:

![puzzle-cube-004](/img/puzzle-cube-004.png)

The element in the top right corner is not connected to the rest of the green-coloured face! To solve this, we must choose the value of each corner randomly from the value of neighbouring elements. This ensures that each corner remains connected to a puzzle piece.

In the code, we visit each of the 8 corners by again considering the index extremes of each axis. A delta array provides a way of iterating through all neighbouring elements. A python set is used to remove  ensure that having two neighbours of the same value doesn't double the probabilty of that value being chosen, although this is not strictly necessary. The code is as follows:

```python
for idx in product((0, -1), (0, -1), (0, -1)):
    delta = np.copysign(np.eye(3), idx).astype(np.int)
    array[idx] = np.random.choice(
        list(set(array[tuple(idx + i)] for i in delta)))
```

By now the array should look like this:

A complete puzzle!

### Getting each face

From here, getting the shape of each piece is a simple as checking each face for elements containing that face's value. This will produce a boolean array to represent each piece, with true values where the piece is filled and false where there are gaps. We store the boolean arrays in a list.

```python
faces = []
for n, (axis, end) in enumerate(product(range(3), (0, -1))):
    idx = 3*[slice(None)]
    idx[axis] = end
    faces.append(array[tuple(idx)] == face_values[int(n/2)][n%2])
```

### Converting each face into a solid object

The simplest way to convert boolean arrays into solid, 3D-printable objects as to place a cube at each true value's coordinate. In general, however, we can use any shape as our puzzle element. Using solidpython we can define a python function called *element*, which generates OpenSCAD code:

```python
def element(x, y, size, r=1, tol=.2, segments=32):
    return translate([size*x, size*y, 0])(hull()(
        tuple(translate([i, j, k])(sphere(r, segments=segments))
            for i, j, k in product(*3*[(r+tol, size-r-tol)]))))
```

The shape produced by *element* is slightly smaller than it could be to allow the puzzle to fit together with ease. This means we also need a simple *connector* object too:

```python
def connector(x, y, size, r=1, tol=.2, segments=32):
    return translate([size*x+r, size*y+r, r])(cube(size-2*r))
```

We can use these functions as follows:

```python
pieces = []
for n, face in enumerate(faces):
    pieces.append(union())
    for i, row in enumerate(face):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value:
                pieces[-1] += element(i, j, size)
                if i and face[i-1][j]: pieces[-1] += connector(i-.5, j, size)
                if j and face[i][j-1]: pieces[-1] += connector(i, j-.5, size)
```

### Saving each face

Solidpython provides a function called *scad_render_to_file*, which creates OpenSCAD code from our python definition. Combine this with a call to OpenSCAD's CLI and we have a function for saving pieces as STL files!

```python
def save(obj, name, stl=False):
    scad_render_to_file(obj, name + '.scad')
    if stl:
        call(['openscad', name + '.scad', '-o', name + '.stl'])
        remove(name + '.scad')
```

Let's use this on each piece.

```python
for n, piece in enumerate(pieces):
    save(piece, 'piece_' + str(n), stl=stl)
```
