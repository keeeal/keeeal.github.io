# About Me
###### Hi! I'm James. I'm a PhD student of medical physics at the University of Adelaide, South Australia.


## Research Interests

My honours and PhD studies have been in using artificial intelligence to improve radiation dose estimations as quickly and effectively as possible. However, I am interested in all things machine learning and jump at any opportunity to apply my physics and computational skills to other fields. Recently this resulted in me working with some archeology professionals to develop a recognition and classification program for indigenous rock art.

## Publications

1. J. Kowlessar, J. Keal, D. Wesley, I. Moffat: One-shot machine learning for rock art style analysis, Pattern Recognition Letters, 2019. *(under review)*
