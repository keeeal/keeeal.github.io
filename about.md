## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2309403?s=300">

Hi! I'm James Alan Keal.  I'm a PhD student of medical physics at the University of Adelaide, South Australia.

## Research Interest

At a baseline my honours and PhD studies have been rooted in utilising artificial intelligence (AI) to improve radiation dose estimations as quickly and effectively as possible.  However, I am interested in all things machine learning and jump at any opportunity to apply my physics and computational skills to other fields.  Recently this resulted in me working with some archeology professionals to develop a recognition and classification program for indigenous rock art.
