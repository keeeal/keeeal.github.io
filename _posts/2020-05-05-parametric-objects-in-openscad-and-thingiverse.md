This post describes two projects that involved using OpenSCAD to create some simple customizable objects. The first is a push-fit mounting system that can connect almost any two objects together. The second is a simple picture frame that can fit any picture and has some nice shape options too. I will explain how I created these objects while including as many OpenSCAD tips as possible.
