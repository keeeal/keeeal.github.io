# Projects

___

### Honours/PhD Work (2016-Now)

#### Beamz
In my honours I used deterministic fluids estimation to encode parameters of a radiation beam.

I then used these inputs to train a neural net to produce Monte Carlo-derived dose-distributions in artificial geometries.  This network was then used in a patient sample with moderate success.

#### DoseNet
Calculating radiation dose as quickly as Collapsed Cone Convolution, but as accurately as Monte Carlo.

### Misc. Personal Projects

#### **Koi** ...*There's always a bigger fish*
Koi is a project that uses a continuous genetic algorithm to optimise the neural movement-based decision-making of fish in a pond.

#### **Hyper Forest** ...*The descent*
I heard that you like dimensions, so I put a dimension inside your dimension.  Two doesn’t cut it for you?  Have a third.  More like three doesn’t cut it.  Have a forth.  

Hyper Forest is a 2D render of a 3D slice of a 4D world.  Welcome to the descent.


#### **Lifebot** ...*I. Have. Decision. Fatigue.*
Lifebot was only ever supposed to be a personal project.  I tried to turn depression into a technical problem so that I could solve it.   Life has a high degree of equifinality.  

It didn’t matter when I did it so I just didn’t.  Now the bot tells me when to do it and now I’m … fine I guess.  

Full Disclosure:  I do not recommend this bot.   Just go outside.  


#### **Bendy Men** ...*Northern Running Figures*
Style can only exist in the context of other styles.  I made a bot that compares things and produced a relative special-temporal chronology for indigenous rock art on the basis of indigenous art from the Northern Arnhem Lands.

### Adelaide University AI Club \(President 2018-Now)

#### Alpha Pilot ...*Let the robot take the wheel*
Phase 1:  Previous authors have achieved AI piloted flat drone flight - we will replicate this.

Phase 2:  We will give the AI more directions.


#### STEM Musicians ...*Robots CAN make beautiful masterpieces*
Pose estimation via videography as an input for a neural net, output to Project Magenta to make some banging tunes.  

#### Ut3 ...*Ultimate tic-tac-toe*
Living vicariously through algorithms because I don't have time to play video games anymore.
